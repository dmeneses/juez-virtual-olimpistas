Compares the C string str1 to the C string str2.

This function starts comparing the first character of each string. If they are equal to each other, it continues with the following pairs until the characters differ or until a terminating null-character is reached.

This function performs a binary comparison of the characters. For a function that takes into account locale-specific rules, see strcoll.
